# willcodeforflowers
This is a Amy's personal blog. It is meant to showcase my coding journey and help teach about landscaping and gardening. 

This page currently uses HTML5, CSS3 and a tiny bit of javascript. It is responsive for phones and tablets. 

Using lighthouse test, this page recieved a 100 in accessibility for desktop. Still working to improve the mobile score as well as the SEO score.

Future plans for this site include adding a database to properly store posts, hosting it at www.willcodeforflowers.com using netlify, and possibly refactoring to Svelte.
