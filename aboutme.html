            <h2>About Me and This Site</h2>
            <p>This blog is set up to be a weekly posting. I will alternate between something I am 
                passionate and knowledgeable about, plants and landscaping, with something new I am 
                learning, coding and web development. Check back every week to see my new post!
            </p>    
            <p>I do not claim to be an expert on plants and landscaping. I am just trying to share 
                my knowledge and experience from working in the industry for many years. Plants are 
                awesome and if I can help someone grow more flowers I'll be happy.
            </p>    
            <p>I wanted to become a web developer several years ago. I started by taking some classes 
                at my local community college. Then I became a flight attendant and the learning stopped.
                 Now I am trying to get back into it. I attended a boot camp. Currently, I am two years 
                 into my coding revival and still looking for my first professional developer job. The 
                 purpose of the coding sections is to remind my future self some things I have learned 
                 along the way.</p>
