            <p>This blog is my way of combining my knowledge of plants and my coding 
                journey in one place. </p>
            <p>Interested in flowers and plants? Click on plant stuff to view all plant 
                related posts, check out resources, and, maybe one day, play fun plant 
                related games.</p>
            <p>Learning to code like me? Click on code stuff to see what I am working on, 
                insights in what I recently learned, and some of my projects. </p>
            <p>Feel free to check out one or both. The plan is to post once a week alternating 
                between plants and coding.</p>
