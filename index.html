                <h2>Is CSS Grid Accessible?</h2>

                <p>I have been very hesitant to use CSS Grid. Sure, it organizes things nicely in a responsive way, but is 
                    it accessible? If you have used Grid, you know it is all about the div tag. That went against what I 
                    know about accessibility and semantic HTML. After some research, I wasn't able to find much information

            <p>During September and early October many landscaping companies are spending most of 
                their time over seeding lawns. You may be wondering, do I need to over seed my lawn?...</p>

            <p>This blog is my way of combining my knowledge of plants and my coding 
                journey in one place. </p>
            <p>Interested in flowers and plants? Click on plant stuff to view all plant 
                related posts, check out resources, and, maybe one day, play fun plant 
                related games.</p>
            <p>Learning to code like me? Click on code stuff to see what I am working on, 
                insights in what I recently learned, and some of my projects. </p>
            <p>Feel free to check out one or both. The plan is to post once a week alternating 
                between plants and coding.</p>
