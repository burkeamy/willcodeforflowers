                    This post is a resource for future me and anyone else who is learning to code on the go. Some people 
                    can do coding tutorials on their computer during their lunch break. Occasionally people can apply 
                    their coding skills to automate some a task at work. I can't do either of these during the work-week. 
                    I don't carry my laptop to work, and I am pretty sure there isn't a way to computer automate planting.

                    This has been such a long year, but Autumn is finally here. For some of us, that means cooler temperatures, pumpkins, 
                    and leaves. What should you do with all those leaves anyway? I am going to give you several options from super lazy
                    up to no leaf left behind.

                    Most people know about the h1 tag and a p tag. Even the nav tag and article, section, and aside. 
                    There are about 250 HTML5 tags and most people only use maybe 20. That means there are over 200 
                    more available.

                <p>Sometimes it is really hard to pull up those fabulous looking summer annuals and replace them. 
                    Trust me, as soon as the first frost hits, you will be glad you did!

                <h2>Is CSS Grid Accessible?</h2>

                <p>I have been very hesitant to use CSS Grid. Sure, it organizes things nicely in a responsive way, but is 
                    it accessible? If you have used Grid, you know it is all about the div tag. That went against what I 
                    know about accessibility and semantic HTML. After some research, I wasn't able to find much information 
                    about this.  This made me want to dig a little deeper.

            <p>This blog is my way of combining my knowledge of plants and my coding 
                journey in one place. </p>
            <p>Interested in flowers and plants? Click on plant stuff to view all plant 
                related posts, check out resources, and, maybe one day, play fun plant 
                related games.</p>
            <p>Learning to code like me? Click on code stuff to see what I am working on, 
                insights in what I recently learned, and some of my projects. </p>
            <p>Feel free to check out one or both. The plan is to post once a week alternating 
                between plants and coding.</p>
