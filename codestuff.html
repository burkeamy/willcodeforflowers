                    Most people know about the h1 tag and a p tag. Even the nav tag and article, section, and aside. 
                    There are about 250 HTML5 tags and most people only use maybe 20. That means there are over 200 
                    more available.

                <h2>Is CSS Grid Accessible?</h2>

                <p>I have been very hesitant to use CSS Grid. Sure, it organizes things nicely in a responsive way, but is 
                    it accessible? If you have used Grid, you know it is all about the div tag. That went against what I 
                    know about accessibility and semantic HTML. After some research, I wasn't able to find much information 
                    about this.  This made me want to dig a little deeper.
