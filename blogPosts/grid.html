            <h2>Is CSS Grid Accessible?</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2020-10-18">Oct. 18, 2020</p>
            <p>I have been very hesitant to use CSS Grid. Sure, it organizes things nicely in a responsive way, but is 
                it accessible? If you have used Grid, you know it is all about the div tag. That went against what I 
                know about accessibility and semantic HTML. After some research, I wasn't able to find much information 
                about this.  This made me want to dig a little deeper.
            </p>

                <canvas id = "ticTacToe" width="300" height = "300"></canvas>
                <figcaption>fig.1 Tic Tac Toe uses a grid system</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is not a post on how to use Grid. Plenty of folks have already done a fabulous job of teaching 
                grid basics. For me, the best way was to copy and paste the w3schools grid lesson code into my IDE 
                and play around with it. ( check it out here 
                <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp" target="_blank">here</a> )
            </p>
            <p>I wanted to like Grid and use it when making websites.  I tried to use Grid with my semantic HTML as I was 
                building sites. It never worked. My grid was always wrong. Somewhere during my process, I saw you have 
                to add your div in with the semantic HTML to make it work. This is true, but it is still so many divs! 
            </p>
            <p>
                This needed some testing. I created a basic site using Grid and semantic HTML, ran it through a Lighthouse 
                test, and saw the result. It was my first time using Lighthouse. I had to make a few small changes but 
                managed to get a 100 in the accessibility category.  
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                Then I removed the semantic HTML and just had a bunch of divs. This also scored 100. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To be fair, it was a super simple site. I tried to mimic a real-world site with sections and small paragraphs. 
                If you want to see the code it is on my github page (link here)
            </p>
            <p>
                What did I learn? Grid is accessible based on lighthouse testing. Go forth and grid.
