            <h2>Bulb Basics</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2020-12-10">Dec. 10, 2020</p>
            <p>
                Finally, the colder temperatures have arrived and winter is just around the corner. 
                This means it is bulb planting time. Here are some bulb planting tips if you choose to 
                plant some yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first is bulb selection. There are many different species and types to choose from. 
                I'll start with tulips. These beauties come in nearly every color of the rainbow. 
                Including black! They can bloom from early spring to late spring, depending on the variety. 
                There are traditional tulips and double blooming tulips.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Fig 2. Three types of spring blooming bulbs pictured on their boxes</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                You also need to think about location. Are you planting in full sun, part shade, or some 
                other environment? Do you have deer or voles in your area? This is important. Many animals 
                enjoy feasting on bulbs. Tulips seem to be a favorite.
            </p>
            <p>
                One way to deter voles and other animals from digging and chewing on your bulbs is perm-a-til. 
                It is small rocks that you can throw in the hole and sprinkle on top of the planting area. The 
                theory is an animal would not like the feel and stop exploring that area. This is not a perfect 
                solution. You may need to put your bulbs in a buried cage.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you plant your bulbs, be sure to put them at the proper depth. Planting them too deep will 
                prevent them from growing and too shallow will encourage animals and rot. The ideal depth is twice 
                the bulb size. So if the bulb is one inch long, plant them two inches deep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bulbs don't need any fertilizer or extra watering. They are designed to be self-sufficient. Sure, 
                if it doesn't rain all winter they may need some water, but otherwise, they will be fine.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is always a good practice to read the tag. Each plant is a little different and the tag or original 
                container will give you more specific details.
            </p>
            <h2>Here are some of your choices for spring-blooming bulbs.
            </h2>
            <h3>Tulips</h3>
            <p>
                As I mentioned they come in a wide variety of colors. All of the bulbs look the same, so if you want 
                them separated by color, don't mix them. As I mentioned, deer love them. Squirrels, voles, and many 
                other animals also find them tasty. Keep an eye on them for nibbles and keep your animal spray handy. 
                In zone 7, tulips are usually an annual grower.
            </p>
            <h3>Daffodils</h3>
            <p>
                Traditionally only yellow, daffodils now come in shades of white and orange. Some varieties are early 
                bloomers with blooms in February. They are poisonous, so animals will leave them alone. Also perennial 
                and will spread. You may want to divide them every few years to spread them around.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Fig 3. A crate of daffociol bulbs</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Hyacinth</h3>
            <p>
                These are larger bulbs. Deer and animals tend to stay away, but nibbling is not out of the question. 
                The blooms are quite stunning and large. They come in a wide variety of colors and are perennial.
            </p>
            <h3>Allium</h3>
            <p>
                Closely related to onions, Alliums have a slight smell to them. This is a deterrent to animals. They 
                will spread. I have never actually seen them in bloom despite having planted many of these. Maybe that 
                is a sign I am doing it wrong.
            </p>
            <h3>Crocus</h3>
            <p>
                A small bulb, we often plant them in a pot. This is another early bloomer that squirrels enjoy.
            </p>
            <h3>Fritillaria</h3>
            <p>
                The large bulbs like the one pictured are expensive, so do some research before you put them in the 
                ground. I am not familiar with them, but they also smell like onions. Maybe deer will stay away
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are done planting your bulbs all you can do is wait. Unlike most other plants, there is no 
                instant gratification with planting bulbs. Just look at your bare spot and envision what it will look 
                like in the spring.
