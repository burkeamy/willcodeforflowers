            <h2>What do I do with all these leaves?</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2020-11-15">Nov. 15, 2020</p>
            <p>
                This has been such a long year, but Autumn is finally here. For some of us, that means cooler temperatures, pumpkins, 
                and leaves. What should you do with all those leaves anyway? I am going to give you several options from super lazy
                up to no leaf left behind.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Fig 1. It all starts with one leaf. Next thing you know there are thousands</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> 
                The super lazy method of dealing with leaves is don't. That's right, just leave them. If the leaf layer is fairly 
                thin the plants will be fine and the tree will totally appreciate the extra fertilizer in the spring. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have mature trees this may not be an option. Too many leaves can shade out some ornamental plants and might 
                leave brown spots on your freshly seeded fescue lawn.  the leaf layer is thick, think about mowing your leaves. 
                Smaller pieces will breakdown quicker and will be a free natural fertilizer for your lawn and surrounding plants.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some areas have restrictions requiring homeowners to deal with their leaves. Don't worry, there is an eco-friendly 
                lazy option for you as well. Choose an area of your yard to be a natural area. Simply blow or rake all of your 
                leaves to this area. Most native forest plants and trees will love this. After all, this is what the forest floor 
                is made of. This option, and all of the above options, will save you time and money. A great place to keep leaves 
                is on your vegetable garden!

            <p>
                Maybe you don't fit in one of these categories. That is okay. Most municipalities will pick up piles of leaves. 
                Simply put them in the designated area and wait for them to disappear. Many landscaping companies will also 
                dispose of them, for a fee. 
            </p>

                Need to move a pile of leaves? Place them on a tarp and drag it. Dry leaves are surprisingly light. If you don't have 
                to remove the leaves, don't. Trees like their leaves and will be just fine if you let them stay.
