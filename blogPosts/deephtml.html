                Most people know about the h1 tag and a p tag. Even the nav tag and article, section, and aside. 
                There are about 250 HTML5 tags and most people only use maybe 20. That means there are over 200 
                more available. 
            </p>
            <p>If you are reading this and you have no idea what I am talking about, this paragraph is for you. 
                <dfn>HTML</dfn> or Hyper Text Markup Language is the main building block of the web. The latest version is 5. The short 
                explanation is that HTML is made of tags nested in the greater than or less than sign. You can view the 
                HTML of many websites by right clicking on the page and clicking on inspect. If you are looking for a 
                more in depth description, check out <a href = "www.w3schools.com/html">w3schools.com</a>.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <canvas id = "curve" width="300" ></canvas>
                <figcaption>fig.1 Circles and curves drawn with canvas, just because</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Some of them, like the <code>canvas</code> tag, require javascript to work properly. There are a few <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> available 
                ones like web storage and geolocation. These also work along with javascript.

                I have been using the figure tag with an image tag and a <code>figcaption</code> tag. This allows you to group your 
                image with a caption and make it accessible at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are writing a scientific or math related post, you may want to use sub <sub>sub</sub> and sup 
                <sup>sup</sup> to help with writing numbers. You might want to include some <u>underlined</u> text 
                with a u tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you include the time tag in your date, users can add it to their calendar. I used this at the top 
                of the page with the date.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also a <code>code</code> tag you can use to represent a section of code. Who knew?
            </p>
            <p>
                Are you adding a quote to your page? You can use the q tag for a short quote or the blockquote tag 
                for a long quote. Below, I used <code>cite</code> for the author. This will put it in italics. Just defining something? 
                Use the dfn tag. (I used this above when I defined HTML)
            </p>
            <section class = "quoteDemo">
                <q>
                    Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
                </q>

            <section class = "quoteDemo">
                <blockquote>
                     “Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the 
                        not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been 
                        able to reach. The world you desire can be won. It exists.. it is real.. it is possible.. it's yours.”

                Just a few more. Have you ever heard of the <code>kbd</code> tag? It is for keyboard input. Use <code>abbr</code> for an 
                abbreviation. The <code>address</code> tag can denote contact information. Go ahead and give them a try! (I didn't include the last 
                three, but most of the others are on this page somewhere)
