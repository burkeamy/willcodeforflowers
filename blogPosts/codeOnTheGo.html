            <h2>Code On the Go</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2020-12-02">Dec. 02, 2020</p>
            <p>
                This post is a resource for future me and anyone else who is learning to code on the go. Some people 
                can do coding tutorials on their computer during their lunch break. Occasionally people can apply 
                their coding skills to automate some a task at work. I can't do either of these during the work-week. 
                I don't carry my laptop to work, and I am pretty sure there isn't a way to computer automate planting.
            </p>

                Limited time and resources are not confined to landscapers or others who do manual labor for a living. 
                Often single parents learn to code as a means to provide a better life for their families. I know, 
                because this is me as well. In this case, it is not always practical to pay for online courses. Not to 
                mention that interruptions are common and family time is super important.

                How do you learn then? This is what I do. It may not be the best method in the world, and I am defiantly learning at a slower rate 
                than people with more time, money, and energy to put into their learning. That is okay though. Everyone learns differently and on 
                different schedules.

            <h2>What seems to work</h2>
            <p>
                Podcasts are great. Links to some of my favorites are found on the code stuff page (and the plant stuff page if you are interested). 
                This is an entertaining way for me to soak up information. Usually, I listen while I am driving. Sure I don't hear every word 
                (hello, driving) but it engages me. I look up stuff later. They also keep me inspired and provide new resources for me to look into.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also use the SoloLearn app. This is a free app that I have on my phone. I can do a few lessons while I am on my lunch break. While 
                this is not as good as actually coding on my computer, it works. The nice thing about this app is that it gives a taste of many languages.
            </p>
            <h2>What hasn't worked</h2>
            <p>
                I tried downloading videos to watch when I had time. This didn't work because I felt I needed to code along. If time wasn't such a precious 
                commodity, I could watch the video and re-watch at my computer to code along. I have done this.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also tried an audio-book. For me, this was a no. The book I tried was a javascript book and it went wrong for many reasons. One, I really 
                needed to see the code and not just hear some guy read it. Also, it was too technical to listen to while driving. I was falling asleep! When 
                I can listen to headphones at work, I prefer music. I have found that when I am listening to something I need to follow along only brings 
                out the interruptions.
