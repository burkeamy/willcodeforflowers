            <h2>To seed or not to seed</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2020-10-11">Oct. 11, 2020</p>
            <p>During September and early October many landscaping companies are spending most of 
                their time over seeding lawns. You may be wondering, do I need to over seed my lawn?</p>
            <p>To properly answer this question you need to know what kind of grass you have.  There 
                are two types of grass warm season and cool season. Warm-season grasses grow by creeping 
                along the ground and are usually brown in winter. Cool-season grasses are individual 
                plants and are green in winter. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>Warm-season grasses love the heat of summer. A huge advantage is they can spread and 
                repair damaged areas. You can plant an annual ryegrass over a warm-season lawn for green 
                grass all year. However, this does cause problems. The most noticeable is it takes longer 
                to turn green in the spring.</p>
            <p>Cool seasons grow best in, surprise, cool weather. The main type is tall fescue. A 
                well-maintained yard will stay green all year. The main downfall is it is not heat or 
                drought tolerant.  Often large patches will die over the summer. This is the type of grass 
                we over seed most often.</p>

            <p>Back to the original question, should you over seed? Short and simple, it is up to you. 
                If you have a warm season, probably not. If you have a cool-season lawn, you may want to. 
                It is the only way to repair any bald spots from summer wear and tear. Fall is the best 
                time. It allows plenty of cool weather for solid root growth. </p>

            <p>Here are a few tips for anyone wanting to seed a yard on their own. 
                <ol>
                    <li>Aerate your soil. You can rent an aerator from a local equipment rental company. 
                        That is what we do.</li>
                    <li>If you have a layer of dead grass on the top of the soil get rid of it. This 
                        allows for maximum seed to ground contact. You can rake it up or rent a dethatcher.</li>
                    <li>Use the right seed. Find one that is cultivated for your area. Shady seed mix is a 
                        thing, so look at that too.</li>
                    <li>We always fertilize with a seed starting fertilizer. This has a slow-release to give 
                        nutrients a little at a time.</li>
                    <li>For large bare areas, use something to keep the seed in place. You can use some wheat 
                        straw. This might introduce unwanted seeds from the straw. We use a product made from 
                        recycled newspaper. The kind we use requires a specific license to purchase.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>If you are interested in making your lawn a bit greener this winter do some research. Be 
                prepared to spend some money. Be prepared to spend some time if you are doing it yourself. 
                Be prepared to water. Most of all, enjoy being outside.</p>
